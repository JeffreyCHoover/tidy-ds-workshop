This five-day hands-on workshop is primarily based on the book [*R for Data Science*](https://r4ds.had.co.nz). However, there are several other additional free and open source resources available for some of the individual packages we will cover.


## R for Data Science

This book is published by [O'Reilly](https://www.amazon.com/R-Data-Science-Hadley-Wickham/dp/1491910399/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1469550189&sr=8-1&keywords=R+for+data+science&linkCode=sl1&tag=devtools-20&linkId=6fe0069f9605cf847ed96c191f4e84dd).

## Statistical Inference via Data Science: A moderndive Into R & the tidyverse

A whole course could be dedicated to statistical inference and modeling with R. That course should be built around the moderndive book. This book provides a fresh perspective on statistical inference including sampling variablity, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing. All of this is done in the **tidyverse** ecosystem, and so could be dropped right into your normal **tidyverse** workflow of data analysis.

This book is in press, to be published in Fall 2019 by CRC Press. The online version of this book is free to read [here](https://moderndive.com) (thanks to Chapman & Hall/CRC), and licensed under the [Creative Commons 1.0 Universal](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) License.

## Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction

This is an excellent introduction into the ideas and methods for data visualization using **ggplot2**. The book discusses not only how to make different types of visualizations, but to make them *well*. This includes discussion about best and worst practices, what chart types are appropriate for different kinds of data, and how to turn a visualization into a story that can be easily interpreted.

This book is published by [Princeton University Press](https://press.princeton.edu/titles/13826.html). The online version of this book is free to read [here](https://socviz.co) (thanks to Princeton University Press).

## R Markdown: The Definitive Guide

This book is a comprehensive guide to R Markdown, its features, and capabilities. It also offers an overview of many of the most widely used extension packages (e.g., **bookdown**, **blogdown**, **xaringan**, etc.). If you are looking to learn more about R Markdown, this is the place to start.

This book is published by [Chapman & Hall/CRC](https://www.crcpress.com/p/book/9781138359338).

## bookdown: Authoring Books with R Markdown

The **bookdown** package is built on top of R Markdown (http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com), and inherits the simplicity of the Markdown syntax (you can learn the basics in five minutes), as well as the possibility of multiple types of output formats, including PDF, HTML, Word, and others. It has also added features like multi-page HTML output, numbering and cross-referencing figures/tables/sections/equations, inserting parts/appendices, and using the [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com) style to create elegant and appealing HTML book pages. The book itself is an example of how you can produce a professional-quality book from a series of R Markdown documents. You can find more examples at https://bookdown.org.

This book is published by [Chapman & Hall/CRC](https://www.crcpress.com/product/isbn/9781138700109).

## blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown

The **blogdown** package allows you to use dynamic R Markdown documents to build static websites featuring R code (or other programming languages) with automatically rendered output such as graphics, tables, analysis results, and HTML widgets. The **blogdown** package is also suitable for technical writing with elements such as citations, footnotes, and LaTeX math. This makes **blogdown** an ideal platform for any website designed to communicate information about data science, data analysis, data visualization, or R programming. Note that **blogdown** is not just for blogging or sites about R; it can also be used to create general-purpose websites. By default, **blogdown** uses Hugo, a popular open-source static website generator, which provides a fast and flexible way to build your site content to be shared online.

## Hands-On Pogramming with R

Like this workshop, this book is focused on applied uses of R for data science. However, this book focuses much more heavily on the programming aspects of R (i.e., there is no visualization or modeling). Programming is a crucial part of being a data scientist, which is not covered in depth in this workshop. Therefore, this book is a great next step for those looking to continue developing their data science skills in R after this workshop.

This book is published by [O'Reilly](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Programming-Write-Functions-Simulations/dp/1449359019). The online version of this book is free to read [here](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/) (thanks to O'Reilly), and licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/) License.

## Advanced R

Unlike this workshop, which focused on applied uses of R and the **tidyverse** packages, this book takes a deep dive into how the R language works, and how to program with it to make your own tools. This is a must read for anyone who wants to develop their programming skills and become an R developer.
